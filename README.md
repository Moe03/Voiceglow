Docs to programatically interact with the VG widget with JS. React package coming soon ðŸ‘€ <br />
Please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/tQDD7Ap3qt) if you have any feature requests/bugs. <br />

## IMPORTANT: 
The following is subject to change as we're rebuilding our backend systems to handle more channels, and potentially more platforms going forward, we will try our best to keep everything as it is but whenever there is a change in the data structure it is for the better, we'll also be notifying on discord whenever there is a major change, we are specifically going to change the message structure in the 'turns', we'll try to keep supporting the depracated values for some time, overall tho the rest is going to be the same.

# Quickstart:

- **Push a new message:** <br />
Used to push a message by either the human or the bot, see setRuntime section to fully control the AI agent.
```js
window.VG_ADMIN.pushMessage({
  from: 'bot',
  type: 'text',
  payload: 'Hi there from the console!'
});
```
___
- **Reload Chat:** <br />
Used to reload the chat and start a new one.
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.reload();
```
___
- **Get Runtime Data:** <br />
Used to get the runtime which contains the chatHistory, userID, and much more, try it out yourself!
```ts
const vgRuntime = window.VG_ADMIN.getRuntimeData();
```
___
- **Set Runtime Data:** <br />
Used typically now to fully control the conversation, see first usecase at the bottom for more context.
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.setRuntime({
  manualControl: true,
  agentName: 'Atoot'
})
```
___

- **Events:** <br />
  All your agent's events are handled through "VG_Events" custom event.
```ts

function customEventHandler(e: CustomEvent<VGCustomEvent>){
    interface VGCustomEvent<d = any> {
      event: "new_turn" | "new_message" | 'chat_open' | 'chat_close' | 'chat_restart',
      data: d,
      ts?: number
    }
      const eventType = e.detail.event; // can be: 'new_turn' | 'new_message' | 'chat_open' | 'chat_close' | 'chat_restart'

      if (eventType === 'new_turn') {
        // new turn was added, this is specifically triggered when a new response was received from VF API
        console.log(e.detail.data) // logs the new turn that was added and the full turns array
      }
      if (eventType === 'new_message') {
        // new message was added, this is triggered when a new message was added and is visible to the user.
        console.log(e.detail.data)
      }
      if (eventType === 'chat_open') {
        // user has opened the chatbox, works only if render is set to 'popup'
        console.log('You opened the Chatbox.')
      }
      if (eventType === 'chat_close') {
        // user has closed the chatbox, works only if render is set to 'popup'
        console.log('You closed the Chatbox.')
      }
      if (eventType === 'chat_restart') {
        // user has restarted the chat, works only if render is set to 'popup'
        console.log('You restarted the Chatbox.')
      }
    }

document.addEventListener('VG_Events', customEventHandler);
```
___
## Use case 1: <br/>
Full control over the chat:
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.setRuntime({
  agentName: "Atoot", // any string, better to be a one word name.
  manualControl: true // this will disable the AI, VF API and let you have full control over the chat.
})
```
___
Now lets try it out, try the following in the console after the previous script:
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.pushMessage({
  from: 'bot',
  type: 'text',
  payload: 'Hi, its Atoot from the console!'
})
```
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.pushMessage({
  from: 'human',
  type: 'text',
  payload: 'Hey Attot, its Moe how are you doing?'
})
```
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.pushMessage({
  from: 'bot',
  type: 'text',
  payload: 'im good man that tuna yesterday was craaaazy'
})
```
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.pushMessage({
  from: 'human',
  type: 'text',
  payload: 'haha, got some treats for you today!'
})
```
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.pushMessage({
  from: 'bot',
  type: 'text',
  payload: 'YOO THATS LIT!!'
})
```
You can use the previous with whatever API like intercom and have VG as the interface for your chat, then simply set the settings back to the default when you're finished, that will make the AI to take over the convo again, also don't forget to remove/replace the agentName:
```ts
window.VG_ADMIN.setRuntime({
  agentName: "", // any string, better to be a one word name.
  manualControl: false // this will disable the AI, VF API and let you have full control over the chat.
})
```
___
## Use case 2: <br/>
Recording the chathistory with a custom integration:

```ts
interface VGCustomEvent<d = any> {
  event: "new_turn" | "new_message" | 'chat_open' | 'chat_close' | 'chat_restart',
  data: d,
  ts?: number
}

function customEventHandler(e: CustomEvent<VGCustomEvent>){

      const eventType = e.detail.event; // can be: 'new_turn' | 'new_message' | 'chat_open' | 'chat_close' | 'chat_restart'

      if (eventType === 'new_turn') {
        // new turn was added, this is specifically triggered when a new response was received from VF API
        if (eventType === 'new_turn') {
            // new turn was added, this is specifically triggered when a new response was received from VF API
            const newTurn = e.detail.data.newTurn;
            const newTurnsArray = e.detail.data.turns;
            console.log('The New Turn: ', newTurn)
            console.log('Entire turns Array: ', newTurnsArray);

            // now save the new array automatically on your preferred storage..
          }
      }
    }

document.addEventListener('VG_Events', customEventHandler);
```
